 Only a tree with an <svg> element is properly handled. The following work as expected:

$('body').append('<svg width="100px" height="100px"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="39" fill="red" /></svg>');

Unfortunately, if you try to insert a element outside of an explicit <svg> element, it fail. The following does not work as expected

$('svg').append('<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="green" />');

jQuery mistakes event on SVG 'use' element in IE9.


Have a look on jsFiddle​http://jsfiddle.net/sunnythink/gkrhY/

1.All work well in FF; 2.'circle' works well in IE9; 3.'use' fails in IE9; 4.In FF, 'delegate' fails, 'on' is fine.

 The 'hidden' selector documentation at ​http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors/hidden links to ​http://docs.jquery.com/Release:jQuery_1.3.2#:visible.2F:hidden_Overhauled, which says:

"if your element's CSS display is 'none' [...] then an element will be reported as hidden"

This sample code demonstrates that at least for SVG images in Firefox (tested on version 15.0.1), the selector does not function as described for CSS display:none.

As can be seen in the code, a workaround for this issue is to directly test the CSS "display" property, but it would be more convenient (and consistent) to use the selector.

I tested something closely resembling this code in Chrome and the selector worked correctly, but at the moment I'm at a different machine without access to Chrome, so I haven't run it against the code below.
